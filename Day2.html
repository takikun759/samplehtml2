            Specific visions for Web3 differ, and the term has been described by Bloomberg as "hazy", 
            but they revolve around the idea of decentralization and often incorporate blockchain technologies, 
            such as various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[5] Bloomberg has described Web3 as an idea 
            that "would build financial assets, in the form of tokens, into the inner workings of almost anything you do online".
            [23]<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; A policy brief published by the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge defined Web3 as 
            "the putative next generation of the webs technical, legal, and payments infrastructureâ€”including blockchain, 
            smart contracts and cryptocurrencies."[24] Three fundamental architectural enablers of Web3 were identified[by whom?] 
            as a combination of decentralized or federated platforms, secured interoperability, and verifiable computing through 
            distributed ledger technologies.[25]

        <p id="two">Centralization has helped onboard billions of people to the World Wide Web and created the stable, 
            robust infrastructure on which it lives. At the same time, a handful of centralized entities have a stronghold on large swathes of the World Wide Web, 
            unilaterally deciding what should and should not be allowed.

            Web3 is the answer to this dilemma. Instead of a Web monopolized by large technology companies, 
            Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users. 
            Web3 puts power in the hands of individuals rather than corporations. Before we talk about Web3, let's explore how we got here.
